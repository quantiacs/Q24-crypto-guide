    "### **Description**\n",
    "\n",
    "The strategy can open only long positions throughout the entire period of evaluation. Positions are allocated only to top10 cryptocurrencies determined by their market capitalization – liquid crypto assets. Liquidity is defined on monthly basis – the top 10 crypto assets with the highest market capitalization on the last day of month will be liquid for next month. Market Capitalization data is taken from coinmarketcap.com. Stable coins are excluded from any calculation and liquidity definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "In further simple example strategy, for signal definition we use two simple moving average crossover - fast sma (15 bars) and slow sma (34 bars), so when fast_sma is higher than slow sma, the weights are set (long only). Another condition that must be fulfiled is Relative strenght index value of close price have to be in certain levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Considerations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The in-sample period begins on 2016-01-01. Earlier data may be used for testing and training purposes.\n",
    "- The strategy must achieve a minimum in-sample Sharpe Ratio of 1.0 to be considered valid.\n",
    "- There is no limit to exposure by crypto asset.\n",
    "- Manual asset selection or direct hand-picking is not permitted. The allocation process must be [automatic](https://quantiacs.com/documentation/en/user_guide/dynamic_assets_selection.html).\n",
    "- The strategy can open only long positions.\n",
    "- Only data provided by Quantiacs can be used.\n",
    "- Top 7 unique-user eligible strategies ranked by highest Sharpe ratio are winners.\n",
